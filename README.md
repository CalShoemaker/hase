Hase : Fetch Dogs 4 Fun
======

### About
Hase is a Proof of Concept/Prototype of a dog finding & building service. Hase allows you to define parameters to narrow down dogs to an ideal set. Browse dogs & learn, save searches, and build your perfect dog with the help of AI & see which breed combinations & how many generations will be required to produce your dream dog! Upload photos, register your dog, and become part of the community!

#### Notes
- This project primarily serves as a tangible artifact to quantify my React/Redux/TypeScript/REST API/Architecture capabilities. 
- This is not a comprehensive or complete product, rather a rapid artifact as litmus.
- As a frameworks engineer, this stack is relatively newish to me. Approaches may not be optimal.
