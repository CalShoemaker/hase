### About

Hase is a Proof of Concept/Prototype of a dog finding & building service. Hase allows you to define parameters to narrow down dogs to an ideal set. Browse dogs & learn, save searches, and build your perfect dog with the power of AI! See which breed combinations & generations will be required to produce your dream dog! Bow **WoW**, indeed. Upload photos, register your dog, and become part of the community!

#### Notes

* This project primarily serves as a tangible artifact to quantify my React/Redux/TypeScript/REST API/Architecture capabilities.
* This is not a comprehensive or complete product, rather a rapid artifact as litmus.
* As a frameworks engineer, this stack is relatively newish to me. Approaches may not be optimal.
